  <p>This demo is a first draft of a virtual reconstruction of a French medieval manuscript (Châteauroux, BM, ms. 5 &ndash; <em>Grandes Chroniques de France</em>, circa 1460).</p>
  <p>At one point, some of the miniatures were cut out of the manuscript and were thought to be lost. Today, eleven of the fourteen cuttings are held at the BnF (Bibliothèque nationale de France, Paris) while the manuscript itself is in the Bibliothèque municipale of Châteauroux.</p>
  <p>The cuttings are superimposed on top of the mutilated pages, i.e. as they were in the original book, thereby virtually restoring the missing text and decoration.</p>
  <p>The viewer is based on OpenSeadragon and the images are requested via IIIF Imape API from two digital libraries: <a href="http://gallica.bnf.fr">Gallica</a> (BnF) and the <a href="http://bvmm.irht.cnrs.fr"><abbr title="Virtual Library of Medieval Manuscripts">BVMM</abbr></a> (Institut de recherche et d’histoire des textes, CNRS).</p>
  <p>The demo is provided by <a href="http://www.biblissima-condorcet.fr">Biblissima</a>, a French project focused on the written cultural heritage of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.</p>
